# Image Score for Food Estimation

This repository contains notebooks and code of the project in the Digital Image Processing course for analyzing food images with two primary focuses:

- **Blur Estimation**: Detecting image quality issues using perceptual blur metrics.
- **Marker Detection**: Training a CNN to identify presence of visual markers in food images.

## Project Overview

### Blur Estimation
- Here, We estimated the blur using an approximate version of the CPBD (Cumulative Probability of Blur Detection) method.
- Blur degrades visibility of food items, impairing recognition and counting.

### Marker Detection
- For this task, We first created a synthetic dataset and then used it for training a CNN attached with feed-forward network which classifies the images into 2 classes:
  - 0: Images without marker.
  - 1: Images with colored markers under varying lighting conditions.
